# Foosball Tracker Refactoring Status

## ðŸ“‹ VERSION MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

**CRITICAL**: After completing each REQ or major task, always check if the version needs updating:

### Version Update Triggers:

- âœ… **Major REQ Completion** (e.g., REQ-2.1 React Query) â†’ Minor version bump (0.1.0 â†’ 0.2.0)
- âœ… **Phase Completion** (e.g., Phase 1 complete) â†’ Minor version bump
- âœ… **Bug Fixes & Security Updates** â†’ Patch version bump (0.2.0 â†’ 0.2.1)
- âœ… **Breaking Changes** (rare in pre-1.0) â†’ Major version bump (0.x.x â†’ 1.0.0)

### Current Version Strategy:

- **Pre-1.0**: Active refactoring phase, version reflects progress milestones
- **Version 1.0**: Target for refactoring project completion
- **Post-1.0**: Standard semantic versioning for production releases

### Version Update Process:

1. Complete REQ implementation
2. Update `package.json` version
3. Commit with descriptive message: `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z - [reason]`
4. Include version change in PR/merge descriptions

**Last Updated**: Version 0.7.0 (REQ-5.1 Complete - Vercel Platform Optimization)
